# Community governance

This is home of City of Zion (CoZ) community rules and reports.
Our formalization is a reflection of a humble move from NEO team to receive our contributions and if quality work is continued provide support.

There is complete freedom in the targets and objectives of the community. That said, our goal is to improve NEO, so we will align with needs and avoid re-work as much as possible, unless it is to attain a new level of quality.

The initial structure is:

1 - There will be a council, that should always be formed by 9 people. They are the team [council in our org](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfZion/teams/council/members)

2 - There will be a high council formed of 4 members of the council. They are the [maintainers of the council](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfZion/teams/council/members?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=%20role%3Amaintainer)

3 - Any member of CoZ can create and collaborate on projects.

4 - There will be a weekly report delivered to NEO by the high council via a PGP signed email with equal hash as correspondent pull-request in GitHub.

5 - In case of any support from NEO as reward or bounty, the funds will be held by @canesin in a public wallet for distribution.

6 - After 1st of September 2017 any CoZ fund should be held in a multi-sig of the high council that requires majority to unlock.

7 - Rewards distribution will be voted by project, before being received. There must be majority agreement of all 9 council members.

8 - All decisions not explicitly treated in this list will be voted as item 7.

9 - Item 7 voting polls of the council will run for 1 week on #council slack channel and after closing published in the #dev channel.

10 - The high council will be voted every quarter, we will sync with years quarters. The first election will be on 1 October 2017. The newly elected high council can propose changes to this rules during the 1st week after the election, changes should be voted as item 7.

11 - Any member of the council or high council is free to give-up the position at any time, when this happen a election on the council will be made and majority must be achieved to decide a replacement.

12 - Any member of the council that do not vote in polls in for more them 3 months will automatically give-up his position.
